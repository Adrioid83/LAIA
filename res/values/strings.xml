    <string name="intro_what">Android is an Opensource OS built by Google designed for mobile and tablets. It was initially developed by Android Inc. and Google purchased it in 2005. Google releases the code under the Apache License in the AOSP Project (Android Open Source Project). Android has a large community of developers writing applications written primarily in a customized version of the Java programming language. In this guide you will learn how to start in this kind of development.</string>
    <string name="subtitle_what">Features of Android</string>
    <string name="a_what">The UI (User Interface) in Android is based on direct manipulation by touch or even a mouse. Also are accepted swiping, tapping, pinching to manipulate on-screen objects. You will create those objects in your layout and make the function of those objects in your Activity. Those parts are analyzed in this tutorial. The device interacts with the user by the vibration, accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors by your application.</string>
    <string name="b_what">Android devices boot to the home screen with a Launcher App. Those launchers are made with app icons and widgets about the associated app. Third party apps (like yours) will be available on Google Play.</string>
    <string name="c_what">In the top of the screen you will find a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. It can be pulled down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates. Notifications are persistent until read or dismissed by the user.</string>
    <string name="d_what">Custom Compilations of Android</string>
    <string name="e_what">As Android is Opensource, the carriers modify the OS to their devices and also provide their updates with the base of the AOSP. But normally those updates come very late or they don’t arrive, that is commonly called fragmentation. In the battle of Fragmentation we can find CyanogenMod. It’s an aftermarket distribution of Android based on the git of the AOSP channel. It’s officially offered to a large number of devices and ported to almost any android device in a non-official way.</string>
